# Unity Breakout Project (raw version)
This is the version of Breakout for CMC Vellore BioRehab Studio R2 device.
This is the raw testing version (with A/D and arrow key controls) and is **NOT** the version integrated with the R2 device for patient usage and is **NOT** the version integrated into the central R2 device game selection hub & patient data extraction hub.

Code adapted and inspired by multiple Stack Overflow resources.
